I downloaded the map of San Jose from mapzen:
https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/san-jose_california/

This map includes the city area of San Jose and also its surrounding natural area. 

This map is a place where I lived before, so I¡¯m more interested to see what database querying reveals, and I¡¯d like an opportunity to contribute to its improvement on OpenStreetMap.org.
